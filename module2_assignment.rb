#Implement all parts of this assignment within (this) module2_assignment2.rb file

#Implement a class called LineAnalyzer.
class LineAnalyzer
  #Implement the following read-only attributes in the LineAnalyzer class.
  #* highest_wf_count - a number with maximum number of occurrences for a single word (calculated)
  #* highest_wf_words - an array of words with the maximum number of occurrences (calculated)
  #* content          - the string analyzed (provided)
  #* line_number      - the line number analyzed (provided)

  #Add the following methods in the LineAnalyzer class.
  #* initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number
  #* calculate_word_frequency() - calculates result

  #Implement the initialize() method to:
  #* take in a line of text and line number
  #* initialize the content and line_number attributes
  #* call the calculate_word_frequency() method.

  #  provided content and store that in the highest_wf_count attribute.
  #* identify the words that were used the maximum number of times and
  #  store that in the highest_wf_words attribute.

#  Implement a class called Solution.
class Solution
  # Implement the following read-only attributes in the Solution class.
  #* analyzers - an array of LineAnalyzer objects for each line in the file
  #* highest_count_across_lines - a number with the maximum value for highest_wf_words attribute in the analyzers array.

  #  equal to the highest_count_across_lines determined previously.

  #* calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() - determines the highest_count_across_lines and
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines attribute values
  #* print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the values of LineAnalyzer objects in
  #  highest_count_words_across_lines in the specified format

  #* Read the 'test.txt' file in lines
